# The BGS project

This project aims to measure the different Alternative Clustering Methods for the BGS sample of DESI.

## Files

The AbacusSummit Dark Matter catalogs are precomputed in the `prepare_simulations` folder, to apply a filter adapted to the BGS sample.

> The LRG filter did not allow the population of galaxies to reach the expected BGS number density.


## TODO

- [ ] Finish the readme
- [ ] Add plots scripts and notebooks
- [ ] Write the new statistic computation when needed again (+ control notebooks and small boxes !)
- [ ] Add reference simulations here ?
