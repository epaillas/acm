# Dependencies

- Mesh routines for particle assignment and FFT calculations are based on [`pyrecon`](https://github.com/cosmodesi/pyrecon).
- Correlation function measurements are based on [`pycorr`](https://github.com/cosmodesi/pycorr/).
- Power spectrum measurements are based on [`pypower`](https://github.com/cosmodesi/pypower/).
- The bispectrum estimator uses a wrapper around the [`PolyBin3D`](https://github.com/oliverphilcox/PolyBin3D) code developed by Oliver Philcox & Thomas Fl√∂ss.
- The voxel voids estimator uses a wrapper around the [`Revolver`](https://github.com/seshnadathur/Revolver) code developed by Seshadri Nadathur.
