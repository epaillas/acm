# Alternative Clustering Methods

## What is the ACM Pipeline ?

The Alternative Clustering Methods (ACM) pipeline is a Python package that provides a set of tools for **beyond-2pt galaxy clustering** statistics for DESI.
It allows the training of several simulation-based theoretical models to emulate the galaxy clustering statistics (see [Pipeline](pipeline/overview)).
It contains several clustering methods that can be used to estimate the galaxy clustering statistics, such as densitysplit, bispectrum, Minkowski functionals and more (see [Statistics](pipeline/statistics)).

## Why are we doing this ?

The **non-Gaussianity** of the density field at small scales limits the amount of information we can access with the galaxy power spectrum. 
Alternative clustering statistics can access this information at a limited computational cost, but most of them **lack analytic theory models**.

## How are we doing this ?

We train **neural networks** on clustering statistics measured on thousands of **Abacus-based mocks**, learning about how the clustering responds to cosmology and the galaxy-halo connection.
