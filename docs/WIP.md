This page will disappear once the documentation is complete.

## Statistics guidelines

For each statistic, we need : 
- A file with 
  - a brief description of the statistic (see the article)
  - An explanation of the main geatures of the code, with code snippets and tips/notes
  - A standard of storage for this statitic
- A notebook with an example of how to compute this statitic on a mock data catalog
