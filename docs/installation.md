## For Developers


### Installing from Cloned Repository


### Building documentation

The documentation is built using Sphinx. 


<!-- The ``setup.py`` file is designed to ignore and mock the packages that have C dependencies if the environment name is ``READTHEDOCS``.
This *should* allow the documentation to be built on ReadTheDocs without any problem. -->
